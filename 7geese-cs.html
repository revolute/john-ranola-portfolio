        <p class="lead">In September 2020, Paycor acquired 7Geese. As a people performance platform (think: performance reviews, 1:1s, feedback), our customer success team is one of our greatest strengths. Each member is a former human resources (HR) practitioner that provides bespoke advice on starting their 7Geese journey off on the right foot.</p>
        <p class="lead">The acquisition opened up access to a new market: millions of users in traditional industries already using Paycor. How would our high-touch customer service model adapt to this new world?</p>
        <p class="lead">I led the discovery effort to answer this question, approaching it with a service design mindset to ensure we were thinking about this holistically.</p>

        <h2>The context</h2>
        <p>Every new customer is assigned a Performance Coach from the customer success team through the life of the relationship. They use their former experience as HR professionals to ensure the product is successfully embedded into the organisation. This involves an intensive first few weeks full of coach-led workshops, check-ins and training sessions.</p>
        <p>Our experience showed that this human touch was critical for long-term adoption because changing how a company grades their employees’ performance requires a change in culture; it’s not as simple as just installing the software and telling people how to use it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>The effectiveness of this strategy has also come at a cost. Since coaches personally run training sessions, the product itself lacks features that teach users how to use the product in their own time. For example, when users log in for the first time this is what they see.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--wide-media">
        <img class="case-study-image" src="img/7geese-cs-first-login.png" />

      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <p>Without the guidance of a coach, it’s pretty easy to see how HR teams would be at a loss to execute the vision that was sold to them. And when we invited some Paycor customers to try out 7Geese, that’s exactly what happened.</p>
        <p>Here’s some feedback we received from users:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“I wouldn’t even know how to begin rolling this out to my company.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Overwhelmed. I got a whole bunch of links and documentation when it was first switched on, but that didn’t really help me.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One obvious solution would be to hire more Performance Coaches. But this isn’t easy. After all, finding HR professionals that want to work in customer success is a tough ask at scale.</p>
        <p>How might we help people feel more confident using 7Geese when a Performance Coach may not be around? This was the problem space we explored.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>Service design gives us a great framework from which to approach this problem because it emphasises the importance of non-digital interactions between us and our customers. We’re less likely to assume the solution lies solely within our software product. For this project, here is the overall process I followed:</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Conducted a contextual inquiry by shadowing several Performance Coaches onboarding new customers</li>
          <li>Map out a service blueprint of this current state process</li>
          <li>Ideation session using the service blueprint as the conversation starter</li>
          <li>Present and vote on ideas to include into the roadmap</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <h2>Findings and themes</h2>
        <p>Over the course of our research, we found that our insights centred around two themes:</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li><b>Education:</b> when customers buy 7Geese, they’re also buying into a new way to think about people performance. Performance Coaches spend a lot of time teaching the how and why of this new way since it often requires users to unlearn traditional beliefs about performance culture. Training on the day-to-day usage of the product can only happen once this foundational knowledge is learned.</li>
          <li><b>Timing and access control:</b> HR teams are acutely aware that first impressions are super important for adoption of any new software. To reduce the cognitive load on their employees, they’re carefully planning which features to introduce first, to whom, and when. Performance Coaches take on the time-consuming responsibility of coordinating these requirements. This usually involves input from the customer, as well as effort from the product and engineering teams.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These themes organically became the focal point of many conversations and workshops with the product and customer success teams.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <h2>The outcome</h2>
        <p>We produced a service blueprint that focused on the first few weeks of a customer’s experience using our product. It highlighted the significant role that a Performance Coach plays in the successful rollout of 7Geese.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--wide-media">
        <img class="case-study-image" src="img/7geese-cs-service-blueprint.png" />
        <hr class="article-separator" />
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <p>This blueprint was used to run ideation sessions with the product and customer success teams. Participants were presented the blueprint for context, followed by a brainstorm. Ideas were then voted on to determine the most impactful solutions.</p>
        <p>Here are the top ideas and actions that came out of the process:</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li><b>Roadmap:</b> a distraction-free experience for HR admins that focuses on the top setup actions for 7Geese features.</li>
          <li><b>Roadmap:</b> backend changes that make it easy for HR admins to control access to specific features during a phased rollout of 7Geese.</li>
          <li><b>Service improvements:</b> a task force was created in the customer success team to improve how fundamental concepts are taught to users when 7Geese is activated for the first time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The top 2 roadmap items became the next priority for the product scrum teams to build. Shoutout to the other designers I collaborated with on this project: <a class="content-link" href="https://www.toppbrocales.com/" target="_blank">Topp</a> and <a class="content-link" href="https://www.caitlynconnors.com/" target="_blank">Caitlyn</a>. It was a mammoth task to map out all of the finer details and complexities of this process. I couldn’t have done it without their help.</p>
