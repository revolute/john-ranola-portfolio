        <h1>A better car insurance quote</h1>
        <div class="byline">Commonwealth Bank <img class="cba-logo" src="img/commBank-logo.svg" /></div>
        <p class="lead">The Australian car insurance market is intensely competitive, with insurers often competing on price to grab unhappy customers churning from other insurers.</p>
        <p class="lead">CommBank’s insurance product team wanted to see how they could improve sales without resorting to price cuts, which is historically not their strategy.</p>

            Overall the redesigned form saw approximately 20% more visits turning into purchased policies. Also saw an increase in the amount of quotes being emailed for later revisits.

        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>By choosing not to compete directly on price, it actually presented a great opportunity to showcase how user-centred design could drive great sales outcomes. In a nutshell, here’s the process I followed:</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Uncover existing problems through data and user observations</li>
          <li>Work with stakeholders to hypothesise the cause of these problems and ideate on how they could be solved</li>
          <li>Prototype the ideas</li>
          <li>Test the prototype with real customers</li>
          <li>Iterate steps 2-4 from the testing feedback</li>
          <li>Throughout the whole process, work with the visual designer and content strategist to deliver the final assets to the scrum team for build</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="grid__item--narrow">
        <h2>Findings and ideas</h2>
        <p>I analysed the funnel drop-off points and organised a usability test of the existing form to uncover what could be causing potential customers to leave the form. After this, I ran a series of workshops with the design team and stakeholders to generate ideas for solving these problem findings.</p>
        <p>Below were the highest impact findings and the design decisions that came out of the process:</p>
        <p><b>Finding:</b> High drop-off when selecting cover type (i.e. comprehensive vs. basic cover)</p>
        <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Users have many browser tabs open comparing with many insurers at once. They leave at the cover type selection because they see a price and assume it’s the quote, thereby moving to the next insurer to compare with.</p>
        <p><b>Idea:</b> Users already know what cover type they want before they start the form (an assumption we later validated), so if we remove the price underneath each cover type, they will reach the real quote page that has a way to tailor the policy for their price point and to save the quote for later retrieval.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>These ideas and the overall redesign were iterated through multiple rounds of user research and stakeholder feedback. We worked closely with the scrum team during the fortnightly sprints to see how development was coming along and to provide input when issues arose.</p>
        <p><b>Status:</b> Live (as of August 2018)</p>
